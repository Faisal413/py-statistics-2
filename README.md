## Assignment

In this [assignment](assignment.md), you will explore Bayesian and Frequentist
approaches to estimate a sample statistics (proportion). In the Frequentist part, 
you will work on finding a point estimate with its confidence interval;
in the Bayesian part you will use Bayesian updating to calculate outcomes as 
a probabilistic distribution (posterior) based on a prior distribution and 
a likelihood function.
